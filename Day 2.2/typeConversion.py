  # we have different type of type casting in 
  # implicit conversions

  # when we multipy the internal  values and get an answer to a variable then this is cld implicit
x = 10
y = 20

x = x*y
print("your number is " , x , "and its type is" ,type(x))

  # explicit conversion is when we convert a variable type to another type using a function

name  = input("whats your name ?")

print("My name is ", name , "my type is" , type(name))
