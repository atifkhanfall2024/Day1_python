   # first of all we should know about it that what is variable
  # its an object for storing specific values

x= 10
print(x)

xx = "how are you boss ?"
print(xx)

x = x+20
print(x)


# to check type of a variable type(xx)

print(type(xx)) 


#Rules for creating variables
#1: variable name should contain letter  , numbers or underscore
#2: cannot start form number
#3: no space 
#4: name should be short and unique
#5: pyton is case sensitive (Lower and Uppercase are different but writing var in, lower
# case is better)
